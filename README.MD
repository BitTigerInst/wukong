## Description

Inspired by DMK - Rong Zou, Wukong (*https://wukong-bittiger.herokuapp.com*) is a platform built by Team BJGX (白驹过隙) to divide study groups for Bittiger members.

**How does it work?**

1. Members' information is stored in database and each member has one of the following three statuses: active, to be grouped or inactive.
2. Once new members fill information form, the default status will be "to be grouped". Our system will recommend joining certain opening groups based on their preferences and skills. Or several new members will become a new team based on their regions and interests.
3. Group leader can post wanting positions and skills. All the members who want to join a target group can contact their leader.
4. People being inactive for one week will be put into "inactive pool" by group leader. Their team history will be saved. After they want to do projects the status can be changed to active and they can enter the group again.

**How we build it?**

Built by using MEAN stack, and deployed on Heroku.

### [![MEAN Logo](http://mean.io/system/assets/img/logos/meanlogo.png)](http://mean.io/) MEAN Stack

MEAN is a framework for an easy starting point with [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/), [Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org/), [Express](http://expressjs.com/), and [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) based applications. It is designed to give you a quick and organized way to start developing MEAN based web apps with useful modules like Mongoose and Passport pre-bundled and configured. We mainly try to take care of the connection points between existing popular frameworks and solve common integration problems.

### Technologies

#### The MEAN stack

MEAN is an acronym for *Mongo*, *Express.js* , *Angular.js* and *Node.js*

<dl class="dl-horizontal">
<dt>MongoDB</dt>
<dd>Go through MongoDB Official Website and proceed to its Great Manual, which should help you understand NoSQL and MongoDB better.</dd>
<dt>Express</dt>
<dd>The best way to understand express is through its Official Website, particularly The Express Guide; you can also go through this StackOverflow thread for more resources.</dd>
<dt>AngularJS</dt>
<dd>Angular's Official Website is a great starting point. CodeSchool and google created a <a href="https://www.codeschool.com/courses/shaping-up-with-angular-js">great tutorial</a> for beginners, and the angular videos by <a href="https://egghead.io/">Egghead</a>.</dd>
<dt>Node.js</dt>
<dd>Start by going through Node.js Official Website and this StackOverflow thread, which should get you going with the Node.js platform in no time.</dd>
</dl>

#### Additional Tools
* <a href="http://mongoosejs.com/">Mongoose</a> - The mongodb node.js driver in charge of providing elegant mongodb object modeling for node.js
* <a href="http://passportjs.org/">Passport</a> - An authentication middleware for Node.js which supports authentication using a username and password, Facebook, Twitter, and more.
* <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Twitter Bootstrap</a> - The most popular HTML, CSS, and JS framework for developing responsive, mobile first projects.
* <a href="http://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/">UI Bootstrap</a> - Bootstrap components written in pure AngularJS

#### Hosting MEAN on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/products)

Heroku is a fully managed container-based cloud platform, with integrated data services and a powerful ecosystem, for deploying and running modern apps. The Heroku developer experience is based on an app-centric approach to software delivery, and integrates with today’s most popular developer tools and workflows.

#### Hosting MEAN on [Docker](https://www.docker.com/what-docker)

Docker containers wrap up a piece of software in a complete filesystem that contains everything it needs to run: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries – anything you can install on a server. This guarantees that it will always run the same, regardless of the environment it is running in.
